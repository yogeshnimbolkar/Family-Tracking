The main purpose of our site to find the location of the Family member. The projects aim to developed android application for family tracking. This project contains GPS tracking system which can locate individual person in family.
I have seen many families lost their son or daughter in unknown city and the problem was that their son or daughter doesn’t know about place. It was difficult for them to find their son or daughter.  After spending much more time they were met.  So this application saves our time. With the help of this application location of family members can be seen on map.

## Future Scope and Further Enhancement

Beside the GPS devices going through rapid development and innovative design in recent years, the software running these the latest GPS tracking devices also became more sophisticated with enhanced capabilities. As sending real time data on object location and movement continued to play crucial role across various industries software capabilities made great strides to meet these requirements. Real time vehicle tracking already across industries like shipping, logistics and aviation proved to be invaluable and companies are working hard to allow more precision in the transmitted location and movement information. Enhanced mapping capabilities besides integration and combination with resources like Google Earth allowed GPS trackers produce more detailed, precise and accurate maps across any location upon the surface of the earth.
We will add the visiting places for visitor. We can add more two more people and also we can access GPS without internet. We can access live location update.

## Advantages


A family tracking app may sound pretty simple. It should be an easy to use app that uses global positioning satellites (GPS) and a smartphone to give parents up-to-date information about their child’s location. In actuality, the idea of instantaneous tracking of a child’s whereabouts is fairly complex; as is the wide range of options it can offer parents. Monitoring a child’s location can be an invaluable parenting tool and can go far beyond simple tracking. A family locator app gives parents a means to ensure children have been and is where they are supposed to be.
Family tracking apps can be used with a few intentions – safety, accountability and parental peace of mind. It offers families a life-saving technological innovation in the case of an emergency. In addition, a family locator app can let kids explore geographical boundaries allowing a parent to gauge where an intervention is necessary.
On the most basic level, a family locator app serves the basic function of tracking a child. With social location sharing and the utility of so many apps today, acceptance of the family tracking app from our children shouldn’t be so uncommon. In addition, they may come to understand we’ll feel more comfortable allowing our kids to do a wider range of activities we may have otherwise found ‘too far’ or ‘too scary’ with the use of a family locator app. Knowing where our kids are when they’re camping, at an amusement park or on a day trip with friends can free up both sides of a parent and child’s relationship.
